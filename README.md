# Hi, I'm Amanda!
 I'm a data scientist and lifelong learning. I have always been passionate about science and data. My dream was to pursue an academic career, but I found programming halfway through and everything changed. I mean...not everything...I'm still passionate about science and data, but now with a focus on solving business problems with Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

# The future is data! 

    for Data Scientists in Data Science:
        if Data Scientists == “my code”:
        print('Not your average DATA SCIENTIST')
    else:
        print(f’I <code> like a girl {try to keep up}’)

# Let´s {code}nnect!
